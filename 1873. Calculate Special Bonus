Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee's name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

import pandas as pd

def calculate_special_bonus(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    mask = (employees['employee_id'] %2 != 0) & (employees['name'].str[0] != 'M')
    employees['bonus'] = employees['salary'].where(mask,0)
    return employees[['employee_id','bonus']].sort_values(by='employee_id')

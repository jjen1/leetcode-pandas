Write a solution to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

import pandas as pd

def department_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame, department: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    joined = employee.merge(department, how='inner', left_on='departmentId', right_on='id').rename(columns={'name_x':'Employee', 'name_y': 'Department', 'salary': 'Salary'})
    max_salary = joined.groupby('departmentId')['Salary'].transform('max')
    results = joined[joined['Salary'] == max_salary][['Department', 'Employee', 'Salary']]
    return results

Return the result table in any order.

import pandas as pd

def actors_and_directors(actor_director: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    count = actor_director.groupby(['actor_id', 'director_id'])['timestamp'].nunique()
    result = count[count >= 3].reset_index(name='count')
    return result[['actor_id','director_id']]
